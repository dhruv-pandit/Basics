    "- $\\Omega$ is the set of all possible outcomes : **sample space**\n",
    "  - Points $\\omega$ are the sample outcomes or elements\n",
    "  - Subsets of $\\Omega$ are called **events**\n",
    "- For a coin toss, the sample space = {H, T}\n",
    "- $A^c$ is just the complement of event A, or 'not a'\n",
    "  - The complement of $\\Omega$ is the empty set $\\theta$\n",
    "  - The union of two events A and B is thought of as A or B, while the intersection is thought of as A and B\n",
    "- Two events $A_1, A_2$ are mutually exclusive if the intersection of the two events is the empty set. \n",
    "  - A partition of the sample space is a sequence of mutually exlclusive events such that their union gives back the sample space. \n"
